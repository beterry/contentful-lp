## Why I’m interested in Contentful

Contentful is a “headless” content management system (CMS). This refers to chopping the head (front-end) off the body (back-end) of a traditional CMS like Wordpress. Contentful simply stores and delivers content via a RESTful API which can be used by any tech-stack and on any device.

I was introduced to Contentful by the GatsbyJS documentation. I love using Gatsby to build static websites. This portfolio is built with Gatsby. While building personal projects with Gatsby, I wondered what would be the best way to allow a client to manage a Gatsby website after it was developed. It’s important to allow business owners the ability to edit content on a site without phoning a developer.

Using Contentful’s back-end services sounded like a great way to allow a future client to easily manage website content while giving me (the developer) the ability to build blazing fast, highly-custom sites with Gatsby, the framework I love.

### What’s the goal of this experiment?

1. Create a Contentful back-end to store content
2. Read the content from Contentful into a Gatsby site
3. Deploy the site and then edit the content to understand the workflow

I ultimately aimed to understand if Contentful would be a good way for business owners to add and update content on a Gatsby site without involving a developer.
